# Definition of Ready

An issue may receive `ready-for-agent` only when every required item and every applicable conditional item below is satisfied.

The reporter may provide incomplete or unstructured input. The agent is responsible for identifying gaps, asking focused questions, and producing a complete draft. The agent must not turn guesses about behavior, data, scope, or user experience into requirements.

An item may be marked not applicable only when its category does not apply to the work.

## Required for every issue

- [ ] The problem or desired user outcome is stated.
- [ ] The scope of the change is explicit.
- [ ] Important out-of-scope behavior is explicit.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are observable or testable.
- [ ] Relevant text, designs, prototypes, screenshots, API documentation, and other sources of truth are linked or attached when they exist.
- [ ] The canonical requirement source is identified; mutable Jira, Confluence, Axure, or design sources include a precise issue/page/revision/version or captured timestamp.
- [ ] Conflicts between sources of truth are resolved.
- [ ] Dependencies and blocking relationships are identified.
- [ ] No unresolved question can materially change behavior, data, scope, or user experience.
- [ ] The expected verification method is stated.
- [ ] A human has explicitly approved the final requirements.

Silence, inactivity, or an agent's confidence is not human approval. Record approval in the issue or in the active conversation before applying `ready-for-agent`.

## UI and interaction work

When the issue changes a page, component, or user interaction:

- [ ] Interaction, layout, and theme are evaluated separately; each applicable dimension uses an exact approved design, an exact existing pattern already permitted by repository rules, or a recorded choice made for the current task.
- [ ] Each dimension is precise and traceable: an Axure page/revision, exact Figma/Penpot node/version, prototype commit SHA plus route/parameters, or exact existing page/component/flow.
- [ ] For an existing project, every reused pattern names its exact reference and the repository rule that permits reuse. For a new project, no legacy-project fallback is assumed and every missing dimension has 2–3 materially different proposals before selection.
- [ ] A current decision-maker, decision time, and selected version are recorded only when the task introduces an AI-generated option, resolves a source conflict, or intentionally changes an existing pattern.
- [ ] The affected routes, pages, components, and interactions are identified.
- [ ] Required desktop/mobile viewports and responsive behavior are defined when applicable.
- [ ] Applicable loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states are defined.
- [ ] Keyboard and accessibility expectations are defined.
- [ ] Required copy and visual assets are provided, or the issue explicitly authorizes the agent to create them.
- [ ] Allowed visual deviations and the conflict owner are stated when the design, specification, component library, or current product can disagree.

Readiness is independent of framework and component-library choice. Vue, React, Element Plus, shadcn/ui, or any other tool is only a repository adapter and never substitutes for the design and acceptance information above.

## API and data work

When the issue reads or writes remote or persistent data:

- [ ] Endpoints, methods, inputs, outputs, and relevant schemas are defined.
- [ ] Authentication, authorization, error, and boundary behavior are defined.
- [ ] A mock or fixture strategy is defined when the backend is unavailable.
- [ ] Success, failure, retry, and duplicate-submission behavior are defined for mutations.

## Bug fixes

When the issue reports incorrect behavior:

- [ ] The affected environment, app version/commit, route, browser/device, role, flags, and data preconditions are stated when relevant.
- [ ] Minimal reproduction steps are provided or the failure can be reproduced reliably.
- [ ] Actual and expected behavior are distinguished.
- [ ] Impact, affected users, and occurrence frequency are stated.
- [ ] Relevant screenshots, recordings, complete errors, logs, network evidence, or Playwright traces are attached when available and have secrets/PII removed.
- [ ] The failure can be expressed as a regression test or another repeatable check.
- [ ] The behavior that must remain protected after the fix is stated.

## Implementation tickets

When a specification is split into implementation tickets:

- [ ] Each ticket delivers a bounded, independently verifiable outcome.
- [ ] Each ticket links to its parent specification.
- [ ] Each ticket declares its acceptance criteria and blocking relationships.
- [ ] The final ticket breakdown has received explicit human approval.

## Readiness outcome

- If required information is missing, apply `needs-info` and ask only the questions needed to resolve the gaps. A new Issue sourced outside the tracker also remains `needs-info` until the complete spec receives explicit human confirmation, even if the other gaps have been answered.
- When missing information is supplied during an active skill invocation, follow the source-specific same-invocation re-evaluation rule in `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`. Recheck all applicable items above, not only the previously recorded gap. A reply alone is not final approval; apply the approval rule above.
- If the work is fully specified but requires human implementation or judgment, apply `ready-for-human`.
- Apply `ready-for-agent` only when this checklist passes, human approval is recorded, and unattended implementation is appropriate.
- Use `wontfix` when the evaluated issue will not be actioned.
